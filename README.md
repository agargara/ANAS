# ANAS

ANAS is a digital modular synthesizer for the SuperCollider open source audio environment. 

###Features
- Modular - style signal routing between different sound generation objects. 
- No difference between control and audio signals - everything is scaled so that you can plug anything into anything. 
- Feedback possible and encouraged. 
- Integration with the SuperCollider language and patterns / events library. (in progress)
- Five type-switching audio / low frequency oscillators with modulateable parameters and built-in filters, including
  simple analog simulation UGens. 
- Moog-style (almost) fixed filter bank, with modulateable filter frequencies and Hi / Lo pass. 
- 2 ADSR units with modulateable parameters. 
- A super duper delay unit
- Multiplexer / crossfader with built-in LFO control
- Sampler panel with support for recording samples, playing back pre-loaded samples, and dynamically recording, overdubbing and 
  glitching via control signal. 
- Four outputs with modulateable pan, which can double as routing busses. 
- Two inputs with support for direct audio and amplitude detection. 
- Three pattern panels with support for controlling oscillator frequencies, triggering envelopes, or modulating any parameter
  using the Patterns library. These accept signals as trigger inputs to generate the next pattern. 
- 93 Knobs.
