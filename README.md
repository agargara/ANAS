# ANAS

ANAS is a digital modular synthesizer for the SuperCollider open source audio environment. 
code by thumbthumb (adam adhiyatma) and agargara (david cummings) 
with help from the community at Mills College and the East Bay.


### Installation Instructions
- download and install SC3Plugins (required)
- download as zip and extract to Extensions folder
- recompile. 


### Features
- Modular - style signal routing between different sound generation objects. 
- No difference between control and audio signals - everything is scaled so that you can plug anything into anything. 
- Feedback possible and encouraged. 
- Integration with the SuperCollider language and patterns / events library. (in progress)
- Recordable knob automation. 
- Five type-switching audio / low frequency oscillators with modulateable parameters and built-in filters, including
  simple analog simulation UGens. 
- Polyphony within each oscillator. 
- Includes fadeTime features from JITLib. Fade settings in and out! 
- Support for saving and loading presets. 
- Keyboard shortcuts for fast, one-handed patching. 
- Integrated recording button for easy sample generation. 
- Moog-style (almost) fixed filter bank, with modulateable filter frequencies and Hi / Lo pass. 
- 2 ADSR units with modulateable parameters. 
- A super duper delay unit
- Multiplexer / crossfader with built-in LFO control
- Sampler panel with support for recording samples, playing back pre-loaded samples, and dynamically recording, overdubbing and 
  glitching via control signal. 
- Four outputs with modulateable pan, which can double as routing busses. 
- Two inputs with support for direct audio and amplitude detection. 
- Three pattern panels with support for controlling oscillator frequencies, triggering envelopes, or modulating any parameter
  using the Patterns library. These accept signals as trigger inputs to generate the next pattern. 
- 93 Knobs!


### Upcoming

- Replaceable panels
- Multi-filters, generic effects like chorus, phasing, gating
- Drum generator
- MIDI / OSC sync with DAWs.
- Pitch detection.
